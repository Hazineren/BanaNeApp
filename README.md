# BanaNeApp

It is an application where users can talk about each other's problems.
Users can show dislike reaction to each other's messages as 'BanaNE'.
Users can log in with their own accounts, if any. 
Users who do not have an account can register from the signUp screen.
Messages are sent by typing in the Modal that opens.
Who sent the messages, when they were sent and the message content are shown to other members.
If the user has logged in to her account before, she was directed directly to the home page using 'Local Storage'.
I used Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database structures.
